        <h2><a href="./binaural_beat_generator">Binaural Beat Generator</a></h2>
        <p>A simple binaural beat generator. It generates two sine waves with frequencies that differ by the chosen beat frequency, feeding the lower-pitched wave to the left channel and the higher-pitched wave to the right channel. The "binaural" effect comes from each ear hearing only one of the sine waves, so play it through headphones or earbuds for the full effect. The sound produced can be very loud, so start with the volume low and don't go louder than is comfortable.</p>
        <p>When the two frequencies are close enough, the listener hears them as a single note, which wobbles or 'beats' at the chosen beat frequency. For me, this happens when the beat frequency is less then about 4% of the average frequency; your mileage may vary! As the frequencies get further apart, they start being heard as two separate notes but the beating effect can still be heard.</p>
        <p>It's been suggested that binaural beats can be used to affect brain function, through a process known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainwave_entrainment">brainwave entrainment</a>. The evidence for this is inconclusive, so I make no promises about what effect this will have on you, if any!</p>
